This algorith can generate random numbers from only first few specific integers , this  is because for this algorith to work the upperbound must be an prime number and the alpha should be a primitive root of upper bound.

This algorith works for upper bounds in [5,7,11,17,23,53,61,71,101,503], if your upperbound is U this algorithm will generate a randdom number from fist (U-1) positive integers.
random library is used to generate an arbitrary number which is inturn used in our algorithm to generate a random number for the specified upper bound.
